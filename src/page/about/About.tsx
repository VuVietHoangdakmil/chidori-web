          Chidori is Vietnam's No.1 Japanese cafe brand and a pioneer of the
          Coffee in Bed® model. Chidori was founded in Vietnam with a mission to
          improve young people's "life experiences" through Japanese quality
          standard services at affordable cost.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[1.8rem] mt-10  text-text-black--custome-min-100">
          We enable it by investing in automation technology and unlocking the
          true power of human elements in our service with training sessions for
          our staff's personal development.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[1.8rem] mt-10  text-text-black--custome-min-100">

          The Story of Chidori
        </h1>
        <p className="text-[1.8rem] mt-10  text-text-black--custome-min-100">
          {" "}
          Chidori was co-founded by an ex-Goldman Sachs investment professional
          from Japan and a Vietnamese entrepreneur in 2018.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[1.8rem] mt-10  text-text-black--custome-min-100">
          In 2017, our co-founders found out that they share a strong sense of
          urgency to improve a society where mutual trust is scarce. Having
          grown up in Japan and having experienced in depth the level of service
          offered to the youth of Vietnam, we simply wanted to create something
          that did the opposite – a service with a long-term mindset that
          existing players could not deliver.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[1.8rem] mt-10  text-text-black--custome-min-100">
          We want to be a role model for building trust by putting customer
          benefit as the first priority with ethics as a foundation. And all of
          the products are something that we ourselves would want to use every
          day. Therefore, the focus of our services is providing the kind of
          thoughtful and sophisticated service that existing players have been
          unable to provide to the youth.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[1.8rem] mt-10  text-text-black--custome-min-100">
          So, our vision was and has been to become the most trusted hospitality
          company in the market we operate since the start.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[1.8rem] mt-10  text-text-black--custome-min-100">
          We believe that running a business is a form of expression of
          providing a gift to the society that we care about just as a
          successful artist creates songs that eventually enrich people's daily
          lives because it addresses the needs & concerns of the audience.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[1.8rem] mt-10  text-text-black--custome-min-100">
          Chidori is dedicated to solving the daily challenges faced by
          consumers while improving the quality of life for thousands of people
          across Vietnam – especially those youth in emerging cities who will
          shape the economy in the near future.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[1.8rem] mt-10  text-text-black--custome-min-100">
          Chidori offers a personal space, a great sense of comfort and
          high-quality products all at the cost of a cup of coffee. We strive to
          let you take a mini gateway to the holiday and have a quality rest in
          Chidori.
